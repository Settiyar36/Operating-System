A Process Control Block :
-----------------------------------------------------------
    (PCB) is like an ID card or file folder for a process in the operating system. 
    It contains all the important information the OS needs to manage and track a process while it's running.

In simple terms:
    When a process is created, the operating system keeps track of its state and resources in a Process Control Block.
    This way, the OS can pause a process, switch to another one, and then resume the original process later, without losing track 
    of what it was doing.

What does a PCB contain?

    1. Process ID (PID):
    ---------------------------
        A unique number given to each process so the operating system can identify it.
        Example: Think of it like a student ID—each student has a unique number, just like each process has a unique ID.

    2. Process State:
    -------------------------------
        The current state of the process (e.g., running, ready, waiting).
        Example: Is the process like a student actively giving a presentation (running), or are they waiting in line to go next (waiting)?

    3. Program Counter (PC):
    --------------------------------
        This keeps track of the next instruction the process should execute.
        Example:  If the process was a recipe, this would be like the current step in the recipe.

    4. CPU Registers:
    ---------------------------
        Holds temporary data the process is using while running.
        These include things like memory addresses or values the process is working with.
        Example: These are like the ingredients or tools the student uses in their presentation. 
        They are constantly changing as the process runs.

    5. Memory Management Information:
    ------------------------------------
        Information about the memory the process is using (e.g., pointers to where the process's data is stored).
        Example: It's like knowing where a student's materials are stored in a filing cabinet.

    6. Scheduling Information:
    ---------------------------------
        Information that helps the OS decide when and how long the process can use the CPU.
        Example: If the process were a student, this is like knowing how long they’re allowed to present and when they should stop.

    7. I/O Status Information:
    -----------------------------------
        Details about the input/output devices the process is using (e.g., files, printers, network connections).
        Example: This is like knowing which tools or resources the student is using (like a projector or a laptop).

    8. Accounting Information:
    ----------------------------
        Information like how much CPU time the process has used or other resource usage.
        Example: It’s like keeping track of how much time each student has spent on their presentation.
