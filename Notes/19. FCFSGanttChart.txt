Given Data:
------------------------------
We have 4 processes: P1, P2, P3, P4.
All processes arrive at time 0.
Burst Time (CPU time):
P1: 5 units
P2: 8 units
P3: 3 units
P4: 6 units
The arrival time for all processes is 0 (simultaneous arrival).

Steps for FCFS:
-------------------------------
In FCFS, the process that arrives first is executed first, and it runs to completion without being interrupted.

Gantt Chart:
------------------------------
The processes execute in the order of their arrival, so:

P1 runs first from 0 to 5.
P2 runs next from 5 to 13 (after P1).
P3 runs next from 13 to 16 (after P2).
P4 runs last from 16 to 22 (after P3).
Hereâ€™s the Gantt Chart for FCFS:


Time	0	          5	         13	        16	        22
P1	    ------  	------			
P2		            ------	    ------		
P3			                    ------		
P4				                           ------   	------


Completion Time (CT):
----------------------------------
P1: Completes at time 5.
P2: Completes at time 13.
P3: Completes at time 16.
P4: Completes at time 22.


Turnaround Time (TAT):
-------------------------------

Turnaround Time = Completion Time (CT) - Arrival Time.

TAT of P1 = 5 - 0 = 5 units.
TAT of P2 = 13 - 0 = 13 units.
TAT of P3 = 16 - 0 = 16 units.
TAT of P4 = 22 - 0 = 22 units.


Waiting Time (WT):
-----------------------------
Waiting Time = Turnaround Time (TAT) - Burst Time.

WT of P1 = 5 - 5 = 0 units.
WT of P2 = 13 - 8 = 5 units.
WT of P3 = 16 - 3 = 13 units.
WT of P4 = 22 - 6 = 16 units.


Response Time (RT):
----------------------------
Response Time = Time when the process first starts executing - Arrival Time.

RT of P1 = 0 - 0 = 0 units.
RT of P2 = 5 - 0 = 5 units.
RT of P3 = 13 - 0 = 13 units.
RT of P4 = 16 - 0 = 16 units.


Summary Table:
----------------------------
Process     	Arrival Time	Burst Time	Completion Time (CT)	Turnaround Time (TAT)	Waiting Time (WT)	Response Time (RT)
P1              	0	            5	        5	                        5               	0	                    0
P2	                0	            8	        13                      	13              	5	                    5
P3	                0	            3	        16	                        16              	13	                    13
P4              	0	            6	        22	                        22                 	16	                    16


Key Metrics:
---------------------
Average Turnaround Time (TAT) = (5 + 13 + 16 + 22) / 4 = 14 units
Average Waiting Time (WT) = (0 + 5 + 13 + 16) / 4 = 8.5 units
Average Response Time (RT) = (0 + 5 + 13 + 16) / 4 = 8.5 units


Visual Gantt Chart Representation (for FCFS):
---------------------------------------------------------------


| Time | 0   | 5   | 13  | 16  | 22  |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| P1   |-----|-----|     |     |     |
| P2   |     |-----|-----|     |     |
| P3   |     |     |-----|     |     |
| P4   |     |     |     |-----|-----|


P1 starts at time 0 and runs for 5 units.
P2 starts at time 5 and runs for 8 units.
P3 starts at time 13 and runs for 3 units.
P4 starts at time 16 and runs for 6 units.


Conclusion:
----------------------------------

In FCFS, processes are executed in the order of their arrival time.
The waiting time is higher for processes that arrive later, as they need to wait for the previous processes to finish.
The turnaround time is simply the total time from arrival to completion for each process.
