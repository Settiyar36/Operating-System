An Introduction To The Operating System
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is an Operating System?
-----------------------------

An operating system is a piece of software that manages all the resources of a computer system, both hardware and software,
 and provides an environment in which the user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner.

 
Operating system objectives: 
-----------------------------

--> Execute user programs and make solving user problems easier  

--> Make the computer system convenient to use 

--> Use the computer hardware in an efficient manner


Tasks offered by an Operating System:
--------------------------------------

Program implementation:

    Operating system loads a program into memory and executes the program. 
    The program must be able to end its execution, either normally or abnormally.

 

I/O Performance:

    I/O means any file or any specific I/O device. Program may require any I/O  device while running. 
    So the operating system must provide the required I/O.

 


File system manipulation:

    Program needs to read a file or write a file. The operating system gives the permission to the program for
     operation on file.

 

Communication:

    Data transfer between two processes is required for some lime. 
    The both processes are on the one computer or on different computers but connected through computer 
    network Communication may be implemented by two methods: 
        shared memory and message passing.

 

Error detection:

    Error may occur in CPU, in I/O device or in the memory hardware. 
    The operating system constantly needs to be aware of possible errors. 
    It should take the appropriate action to ensure correct and consistent computing.
