 Spatial and Temporal Locality
Spatial Locality: Refers to the tendency of programs to access nearby memory locations within a short period.
Example: If a program accesses one memory address, it's likely to access adjacent addresses soon.
Importance: Helps in optimizing caching and paging algorithms.
Temporal Locality: Refers to the tendency of programs to access the same memory locations repeatedly over a short period.
Example: A variable that is accessed multiple times in quick succession.
Importance: Optimizes caching strategies by keeping recently accessed data in fast memory.
