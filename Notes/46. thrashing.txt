. Thrashing
What is it?

Thrashing happens when the system spends more time swapping data between RAM and disk (virtual memory) than executing actual processes. It occurs when the system is overloaded and can't manage its memory effectively.
Why does it happen?

When multiple processes are running, and there isn't enough physical memory (RAM) to hold all the data, the OS swaps parts of processes in and out of virtual memory (stored on the disk).
If too many processes are trying to access memory at once, the system ends up using most of its time swapping data rather than performing useful work, leading to a performance bottleneck.
Example:

Imagine you have 5 apps open on your computer, but your computer only has enough memory for 3. The OS starts swapping data to and from the hard disk, which makes the system very slow.
