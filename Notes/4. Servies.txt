OPERATING SYSTEM SERVICES:
--------------------------------------------------------
    OS provides different types of services for both user and programs to execute programs in a convinient way.

1. Program execution
2. I/O operation
3. User interface
4. File system manipulation
5. error detection
6. communication
7. resource allocation
8. accounting
9.protection & security


Description	Key Functions
1. Program Execution:
    Manages the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.	
        - Process creation and termination
        - Process scheduling (CPU allocation)
        - Process synchronization and communication

2. I/O Operations:
	Manages interaction with external devices like keyboards, printers, disks, etc.
    	- Device drivers
        - Buffering and caching
        - I/O scheduling and queuing
        - Interrupt handling

3. User Interface (UI):
	Provides interfaces (CLI or GUI) for users to interact with the system.	
        - Command-line interface (CLI) for text-based interaction
        - Graphical user interface (GUI) for visual interaction
        - Window management and event handling

4. File System Manipulation	:
    Manages the storage, organization, and retrieval of files on storage devices.
    	- File creation, modification, and deletion
        - Directory management
        - File access control and permissions

5. Error Detection:
	Detects errors in the system and attempts to resolve or report them.
    	- Hardware error detection (e.g., memory, CPU errors)
        - Software error handling (e.g., exceptions)
        - Logging and reporting errors

6. Communication:
    Manages communication between processes or systems, including inter-process communication (IPC) and networking.	
        - Inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms (e.g., message passing, shared memory)
        - Remote procedure calls (RPC)
        - Networking protocols and data transfer

7. Resource Allocation:
    	Allocates resources like CPU time, memory, and I/O devices to various processes and users.
        	- CPU scheduling
            - Memory allocation (e.g., paging, segmentation)
            - Disk and I/O device allocation

8. Accounting:
	Tracks resource usage for users, processes, or applications, often for billing or auditing purposes.
    	- Usage tracking (CPU time, memory, disk space)
        - Billing and quota management
        - Auditing system usage

9. Protection & Security:
    Ensures data and resources are protected from unauthorized access and misuse.	- Authentication (user login)
        - Authorization (access control)
        - Encryption and decryption
        - Access control lists (ACLs)
        - Virus and malware protection

10. Memory Management:
	Allocates and deallocates memory to processes, and manages virtual memory.
    	- Memory allocation and deallocation
        - Virtual memory management (paging, segmentation)
        - Memory protection

11. Device Management:
	Manages I/O devices and ensures proper communication between devices and the OS.	
    - Device drivers
    - I/O scheduling
    - Buffering and caching
    - Device status monitoring

12. Networking Services:
	Provides the OS with the ability to communicate over networks.	
        - Network protocol handling (TCP/IP, etc.)
        - Socket programming for network communication
        - Routing and firewall management

13. System Performance Monitoring:
	Monitors system health and performance metrics, optimizing resource usage.
    	- CPU, memory, disk usage monitoring
        - Performance metrics reporting
        - Diagnostics and alerts

14. Power Management:
	Manages system power consumption, especially in mobile devices.	
    - Sleep and hibernate modes
    - Power-saving mechanisms for hardware components
    - Battery monitoring and management
