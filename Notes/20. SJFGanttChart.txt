Given Data:
-------------------------------
Arrival Time: All processes arrive at time 0.
Burst Time:
P1: 5 units
P2: 8 units
P3: 3 units
P4: 6 units

Steps for SJF:

    In SJF, processes are executed based on their burst time. The process with the shortest burst time is executed first,
     and if two processes have the same burst time, they are executed based on their order of arrival. 
     Since all processes arrive at the same time in this case, we will pick the process with the shortest burst time first.

Step-by-Step Execution (Gantt Chart):
----------------------------------------------
P3 has the shortest burst time (3 units), so it runs first.
P1 has the next shortest burst time (5 units), so it runs second.
P4 comes next with 6 units of burst time.
P2 runs last because it has the longest burst time (8 units).

Gantt Chart:
---------------------------------

Time       	0	      3	         8	          14	        22
P3	       ------	------			
P1		            ------	    ------		
P4			                            	------	
P2				                                          	------


Completion Time (CT):
-------------------------------
P3: Completes at time 3.
P1: Completes at time 8.
P4: Completes at time 14.
P2: Completes at time 22.


Turnaround Time (TAT):
-------------------------------------------
Turnaround Time = Completion Time (CT) - Arrival Time.

TAT of P3 = 3 - 0 = 3 units.
TAT of P1 = 8 - 0 = 8 units.
TAT of P4 = 14 - 0 = 14 units.
TAT of P2 = 22 - 0 = 22 units.


Waiting Time (WT):
----------------------------------
Waiting Time = Turnaround Time (TAT) - Burst Time.

WT of P3 = 3 - 3 = 0 units.
WT of P1 = 8 - 5 = 3 units.
WT of P4 = 14 - 6 = 8 units.
WT of P2 = 22 - 8 = 14 units.


Response Time (RT):
-----------------------------------
Response Time = Time when the process first starts executing - Arrival Time.

RT of P3 = 0 - 0 = 0 units.
RT of P1 = 3 - 0 = 3 units.
RT of P4 = 8 - 0 = 8 units.
RT of P2 = 14 - 0 = 14 units.


Summary Table:
---------------------------------
Process 	Arrival Time	Burst Time	Completion Time (CT)	Turnaround Time (TAT)	Waiting Time (WT)	Response Time (RT)
P3          	0	            3	            3	                    3	                0	                    0

P4          	0	            6	            14	                    14              	8	                    8
P2          	0	            8	            22	                    22	                14	                    14


Key Metrics:
---------------------------
Average Turnaround Time (TAT) = (3 + 8 + 14 + 22) / 4 = 11.75 units
Average Waiting Time (WT) = (0 + 3 + 8 + 14) / 4 = 6.25 units
Average Response Time (RT) = (0 + 3 + 8 + 14) / 4 = 6.25 units


Visual Gantt Chart Representation (for SJF):
----------------------------------------------------


| Time | 0   | 3   | 8   | 14  | 22  |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| P3   |-----|     |     |     |     |
| P1   |     |-----|-----|     |     |
| P4   |     |     |     |-----|     |
| P2   |     |     |     |     |-----|


P3 runs first because it has the shortest burst time of 3 units.
P1 runs second, with a burst time of 5 units.
P4 runs next, with a burst time of 6 units.
P2 runs last because it has the longest burst time of 8 units.


Conclusion:
-------------------------
In Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling, the process with the shortest burst time is selected first.
This algorithm minimizes waiting time but can lead to starvation for longer processes.
P3 has the shortest turnaround and waiting times in this example, while P2 has the highest waiting 
and turnaround times due to its long burst time.
