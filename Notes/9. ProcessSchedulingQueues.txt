PROCESS SCHEDULING QUEUES:
----------------------------------------------
    When a process is running or waiting to run, the operating system needs to manage all the processes that need CPU time.
    To do this, process scheduling queues are used.
    These queues help the operating system decide which process gets to run next, when, and for how long. 
    Each queue holds processes in different states.

Here are the types of queues:

1. Job Queue
    This queue holds all the processes that have just been created and are waiting to be admitted into the system for execution.
    Example: When you open an app, the process is placed in the job queue until itâ€™s ready to start running.

2. Ready Queue
    This queue holds all the processes that are ready to execute but are waiting for CPU time.
     They are ready to run, but the CPU is currently busy running other processes.
    Example: Imagine a classroom where all students are ready to present, but they have to wait for their turn.

3. Waiting Queue (Blocked Queue)
    This queue holds processes that are waiting for some event to happen before they can continue executing.
     For example, they may be waiting for input from the user, waiting for data from a file, or waiting for a resource to become available.
    Example: If you're downloading a file, the process waits in the waiting queue until the file is downloaded.
