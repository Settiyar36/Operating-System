 Windows Services and Drivers
Windows Services: Background processes that provide core functions to the system. They can run automatically when Windows starts.
Examples: Print spooler, Windows Update service, network services.
Drivers: Software that allows the operating system to communicate with hardware devices (like printers, graphics cards, network adapters).
Example: A printer driver allows Windows to send print jobs to a physical printer.
