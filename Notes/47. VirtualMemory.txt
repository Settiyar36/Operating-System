What is it?

Virtual memory is a technique that allows the OS to use hard disk space as an extension of RAM. It gives the illusion that your computer has more RAM than it physically does.
Why do we need it?

When the RAM is full, the OS temporarily moves data that isn't actively being used to a space on the hard disk (or SSD) called the swap file or page file. This allows the system to run more processes than it could fit in RAM alone.
Example:

When you're running multiple applications at once (like a browser, text editor, etc.), and your physical RAM is full, the OS uses virtual memory to store parts of the apps' data on your hard disk so the apps keep running.
