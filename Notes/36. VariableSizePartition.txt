Variable Size Partition (In Simple Terms)
A variable-size partition is a method of memory allocation where memory is divided into partitions of different sizes, based on the needs of the processes. Unlike fixed-size partitioning where memory is divided into equal-sized blocks, variable-size partitioning allows each process to be allocated exactly the amount of memory it needs (or as close as possible).

How Variable Size Partition Works:
Dynamic Allocation:

In variable-size partitioning, when a process requests memory, the operating system allocates a partition of memory that is just large enough to hold the process. The size of the partition is determined by the size of the process itself.
Memory Fragmentation:

As processes are loaded and unloaded, gaps or holes can appear in the memory. These gaps may not be big enough to hold new processes, even though the total free memory might be sufficient. This is known as external fragmentation.
No Wasted Space:

In this method, memory is used more efficiently compared to fixed-size partitioning, as each partition is tailored to the needs of the process.
Example:
Suppose you have 1 GB of memory, and you have three processes:

Process 1 needs 200 MB of memory.
Process 2 needs 500 MB of memory.
Process 3 needs 150 MB of memory.
In variable-size partitioning:

Process 1 gets a 200 MB partition.
Process 2 gets a 500 MB partition.
Process 3 gets a 150 MB partition.
The memory usage is flexible, and each partition fits the specific needs of the process, unlike fixed-size partitions where memory might go unused.

Advantages of Variable Size Partitioning:
Efficient Memory Use: There is less wasted space since each partition is sized based on the needs of the process.
Flexibility: The system can allocate memory dynamically and more flexibly.
Disadvantages:
External Fragmentation: As processes are loaded and unloaded, free memory can be scattered in small blocks, leading to wasted space in the form of holes.
Complex Memory Management: The operating system has to keep track of free spaces of varying sizes, making memory management more complex.
