PROCESS STATES:
------------------------------------
    process states describe the different stages a process goes through while it's running. 
    Think of it as the life cycle of a process. 
    Each state represents a specific point in the process's journey from start to finish.

Here are the basic process states:

1. New (Created):

    What it is: The process is just created but hasn't started running yet.
    Example: When you double-click on an application to open it, the operating system creates a process for it, but it's not running yet.

2. Ready (Waiting to Run):

    What it is: The process is ready to run, but the CPU (the brain of the computer) is not available right now because 
    it's busy running another process.
    Example: Imagine multiple people waiting in line to talk to a bank teller. 
    They're ready to go, but they have to wait their turn.

3. Running (Executing):

    What it is: The process is currently being executed by the CPU. It’s actively doing its work.
    Example: If you're watching a video on YouTube, the process of playing the video is in the running state.

4. Blocked (Waiting) (Not Ready to Run):

    What it is: The process cannot continue because it's waiting for something to happen, like waiting for input from the user
     or waiting for a file to load.
    Example: If you're waiting for a file to download before opening it, the process is in the blocked state until the download is complete.

5. Terminated (Exit):

    What it is: The process has finished its work and is now stopped. 
    All of its resources (memory, CPU time) are cleaned up and released back to the system.
    Example: After you close an app, it goes into the terminated state.
    The process is done, and the operating system removes it from memory.

Process State Transitions:
    A process can move from one state to another based on different events, 
    like when the CPU becomes available or when the process finishes waiting for something.

For example:

From New → Ready (Process is created and waiting to run).

From Ready → Running (CPU starts executing the process).

From Running → Blocked (Process needs to wait for something).

From Blocked → Ready (Process is ready to run again after waiting).

From Running → Terminated (Process finishes executing).
