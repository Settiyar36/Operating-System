Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF):
    SRTF is a preemptive version of the Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm. '
    In SRTF, the process with the shortest remaining burst time is executed first. 
    If a new process arrives with a shorter remaining burst time, it preempts the currently running process 
    and starts executing instead.
    This algorithm can result in preemption, meaning a process that is currently running can be interrupted and later resumed.


Given Data:
--------------------------------
Arrival Time: All processes arrive at time 0.
Burst Time:
P1: 5 units
P2: 8 units
P3: 3 units
P4: 6 units

Quantum Time:
     Since SRTF is preemptive, we do not require a fixed quantum time; the process with the shortest remaining burst time is always selected.

Step-by-Step Execution (Gantt Chart):
-------------------------------------------------
Initially, all processes arrive at time 0.
At time 0, P3 has the shortest burst time of 3 units, so it starts first.
After P3 finishes, P1 has the shortest remaining burst time of 5 units, so it runs next.
Next, P4 runs because it has the shortest remaining burst time of 6 units.
Finally, P2 runs last with 8 units of burst time.

Hereâ€™s the Gantt Chart:
---------------------------------


Time	0	3	5	8	14	20	22
P3	------	------					
P1			------	------			
P4					------	------	
P2							------


Completion Time (CT):
-----------------------------------
P3: Completes at time 3.
P1: Completes at time 8.
P4: Completes at time 14.
P2: Completes at time 22.


Turnaround Time (TAT):
----------------------------------
Turnaround Time = Completion Time (CT) - Arrival Time.

TAT of P3 = 3 - 0 = 3 units.
TAT of P1 = 8 - 0 = 8 units.
TAT of P4 = 14 - 0 = 14 units.
TAT of P2 = 22 - 0 = 22 units.


Waiting Time (WT):
-----------------------------------------------
Waiting Time = Turnaround Time (TAT) - Burst Time.

WT of P3 = 3 - 3 = 0 units.
WT of P1 = 8 - 5 = 3 units.
WT of P4 = 14 - 6 = 8 units.
WT of P2 = 22 - 8 = 14 units.


Response Time (RT):
--------------------------------------------
Response Time = Time when the process first starts executing - Arrival Time.

RT of P3 = 0 - 0 = 0 units.
RT of P1 = 3 - 0 = 3 units.
RT of P4 = 8 - 0 = 8 units.
RT of P2 = 14 - 0 = 14 units.

P4	                0           	6	        14	                        14	                   8	                8
P2	                0              	8	        22	                        22	                   14	                14


Key Metrics:
------------------------------------
Average Turnaround Time (TAT) = (3 + 8 + 14 + 22) / 4 = 11.75 units
Average Waiting Time (WT) = (0 + 3 + 8 + 14) / 4 = 6.25 units
Average Response Time (RT) = (0 + 3 + 8 + 14) / 4 = 6.25 units

P3 starts first at time 0 and runs for 3 units.
P1 starts next at time 3 and runs for 5 units.
P4 starts at time 8 and runs for 6 units.
P2 runs last, starting at time 14 and completing at time 22.


Conclusion:
-----------------------------------------
Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) allows for preemption based on the shortest remaining burst time.
Processes that have a shorter remaining time are always chosen first, which results in minimizing waiting time for shorter processes.
However, SRTF can lead to starvation for processes that have longer burst times, as shorter jobs keep preempting them.
