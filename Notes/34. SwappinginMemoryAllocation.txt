Swapping in Memory Allocation (In Simple Terms)
Swapping is a memory management technique used in operating systems to manage the available main memory (RAM) more efficiently. It allows a process that is currently running in memory to be moved (or "swapped") out to secondary storage (usually a hard drive or SSD), freeing up space in RAM for other processes. Later, the process can be swapped back into memory when it needs to continue execution.

How Swapping Works:
Move Process Out of Memory:

When the system is running low on available memory (RAM), and if there are processes that are not actively being used, the operating system can swap out a process from RAM and store it on disk (typically in a swap space or swap file).
This is done so that the system can make room for other active processes.
Bring Process Back into Memory:

When the swapped-out process needs to continue executing (for example, when it's ready to perform another task), the operating system swaps it back from the disk into the available RAM.
If necessary, another process may be swapped out to make space for the incoming process.
Key Terms:
Swapping in: Bringing a process from disk into memory.
Swapping out: Moving a process from memory to disk.
Why is Swapping Used?:
Memory Shortage: When the system runs out of physical memory (RAM), swapping allows the operating system to continue running more processes than the physical memory can hold.
Better Resource Management: It optimizes the use of available memory and prevents the system from crashing due to memory shortage.
Example of Swapping:
Let’s say there are 3 processes (P1, P2, P3) and only 2 GB of RAM available.

Initially, P1 and P2 are loaded into RAM.
When P3 needs to run but there isn’t enough space in RAM:
The system can swap P1 out to disk (if it's not actively needed) and load P3 into RAM.
When P1 is needed again, the system will swap P2 or P3 out to disk and bring P1 back into memory.
Advantages of Swapping:
More Processes in Memory: Allows running more processes than the system’s physical memory can hold by using secondary storage.
Efficient Memory Usage: Helps in utilizing memory better when the system is overloaded with processes.
System Stability: Prevents crashes due to lack of memory by swapping out inactive processes.
Disadvantages of Swapping:
Performance Overhead: Swapping can slow down the system because reading from and writing to disk is much slower than accessing RAM.
Disk Space Usage: Swapping requires disk space, and if the system runs out of space on the disk, it can lead to issues.
Increased Latency: There is a delay when swapping processes in and out of memory, leading to higher response times for users.
