Types of Schedulers:
-------------------------------------------
    Schedulers are responsible for choosing which process gets the CPU.
    There are three types of schedulers:

1. Long-Term Scheduler (Job Scheduler)
    The long-term scheduler decides which processes should be admitted into the system from the job queue to be executed.
     It controls the degree of multiprogramming, meaning how many processes can run at the same time.
    Example: When you open a program, the long-term scheduler decides whether to let it into the system based on resources like memory.

2. Short-Term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler)
    The short-term scheduler decides which process in the ready queue gets to use the CPU next. 
    This scheduler is responsible for switching between processes and allocating CPU time quickly.
    Example: If you're using a web browser, the short-term scheduler decides which tab (process) gets CPU time when you switch between them.

3. Medium-Term Scheduler (Swapper)
    The medium-term scheduler controls which processes should be swapped in and out of memory.
     If the system is overloaded, the medium-term scheduler may swap a process from memory to disk and vice versa, 
     so the system can make room for processes that need CPU time.
    Example: If your computer runs out of RAM, the medium-term scheduler might swap less important processes (like a background app)
     to the disk, freeing up space for more urgent processes.
