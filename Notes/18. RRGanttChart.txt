RR SCHEDULING:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say we have 4 processes P1, P2, P3, P4, and they arrive at time 0.

Process Info:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arrival Time: All processes arrive at time 0.
Burst Time (CPU time):
P1: 5 units
P2: 8 units
P3: 3 units
P4: 6 units
Quantum Time: 4 units (This is the time slice each process gets in Round Robin scheduling.)

    We are using Round Robin (RR) scheduling with a time quantum of 4 units.

1. P1 starts at time 0 and runs for 4 units.
2. After that, it goes back to the queue, and P2 runs for 4 units.
3. The cycle continues with each process getting CPU time in a circular manner.

Explanation:
--------------------
    P1 runs for 4 units, then P2 runs for 4 units, and so on. This process continues until all processes have finished.
    

2. Completion Time (CT):
--------------------------------------------------------
The time at which each process completes execution.

P1: Completes at time 24.
P2: Completes at time 22.
P3: Completes at time 20.
P4: Completes at time 24.

3. Turnaround Time (TAT):
------------------------------------------------------
Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time.

TAT of P1 = 24 - 0 = 24 units.
TAT of P2 = 22 - 0 = 22 units.
TAT of P3 = 20 - 0 = 20 units.
TAT of P4 = 24 - 0 = 24 units.


4. Waiting Time (WT):
--------------------------------------------------------
Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - Burst Time.

WT of P1 = 24 - 5 = 19 units.
WT of P2 = 22 - 8 = 14 units.
WT of P3 = 20 - 3 = 17 units.
WT of P4 = 24 - 6 = 18 units.


5. Response Time (RT):
------------------------------------------------------------
Response Time = First Response Time - Arrival Time.

RT of P1 = 0 (It starts immediately).
RT of P2 = 4 (Starts after P1).
RT of P3 = 8 (Starts after P2).
RT of P4 = 11 (Starts after P3).


GENERAL representation:

Process 	Arrival Time    Burst Time  	Completion Time (CT)	Turnaround Time (TAT)	Waiting Time (WT)	Response Time (RT)
P1	            0	             5	                24	                    24	                19	                    0
P2	            0	             8	                22	                    22	                14	                    4
P3	            0	             3	                20	                    20	                17	                    8
P4	            0	             6	                24	                    24	                18	                    11
