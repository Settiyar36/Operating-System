SCHEDULING CRITERIA:
----------------------------
    When it comes to process scheduling in an operating system, scheduling criteria are the different factors or goals
     that the operating system considers when deciding which process should get the CPU time next.
    -> In simple terms, these criteria are like rules or goals the operating system follows to make sure the system 
        runs efficiently and fairly.

1. CPU Utilization:
---------------------------
    The operating system tries to keep the CPU as busy as possible, meaning it wants to maximize the usage of the CPU. 
    If the CPU is idle, the system isn’t being efficient.
      Goal: Keep the CPU working most of the time.
      Example: The OS may prioritize running processes that can use the CPU immediately to avoid wasting time.

2. Throughput:
----------------------------
    This is the number of processes completed per unit of time.
        Goal: The OS wants to maximize the number of tasks completed in a given time.
        Example: If a system is running a batch of calculations, throughput means how many calculations can be completed in an hour.

3. Turnaround Time:
------------------------------
    The total time taken for a process to complete, from the moment it arrives in the system to when it finishes.
        Goal: Minimize the turnaround time so processes can finish quickly.
        Example: If you’re uploading a file, the turnaround time is how long it takes from the start of the upload until the file is completely uploaded.
    
    Forumula: Turnaround time=Compile time-arrival time


4. Waiting Time:
-------------------------
    The amount of time a process spends waiting in the ready queue before it gets executed.
        Goal: Minimize the waiting time for processes, so they don’t sit around idle.
        Example: Imagine you’re at a restaurant. Waiting time is how long you have to wait before your food is served 
        after you’ve ordered. The goal is to minimize this wait.

    Forumula: Waiting time= Turnaround time -Burst time 

        Burst time is the amount of time a process requires to complete its execution on the CPU, without interruption.


5. Response Time:
------------------------------
    The time between a process’s request for service and the first response the system gives back.
        Goal: Minimize the response time to make the system feel more interactive and responsive.
        Example: In a web browser, response time is how long it takes for the browser to start showing a webpage
         after you click on a link.

6. Fairness:
----------------------------
    Ensuring that each process gets a fair share of CPU time, so no process is unfairly starved or given too much CPU time.
        Goal: Achieve fairness among all processes, so no process is ignored or monopolizes the CPU.
        Example: If there are multiple apps running, fairness ensures that no one app takes all the CPU time 
        while others are left waiting
